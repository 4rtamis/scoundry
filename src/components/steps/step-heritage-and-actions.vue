    <h2>Choose your heritage and assign action dots</h2>
    <p>
      Your character's heritage describes where their family line is from.
      Assign four action dots. Your playbook begins with three action dots
      already placed. You get to add four more dots. At the start of the game,
      no action may have more than two dots.
